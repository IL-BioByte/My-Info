👋 Hi, My name is Yilan.

💼 I’m a data analyst working in biotech. My work involves data manipulation, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis using R, Python, SQL.

👀 I also enjoy creating custom software to automate and streamline my work.

💞️ I like connecting with fellow coding enthusiasts. I’m actively building my  <a href="https://il-biobyte.github.io/-IL-BioByte-.github.io/"> portfolio </a> to showcase my work.

📝 I share my journey on Github about transitioning from biotech to data analytics and tackling impactful projects.

📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/yilanli5200173">LinkedIn.</a>

🐕 I am also a proud parent of a GERMAN SHEPHERD who is sometimes an asshole.
