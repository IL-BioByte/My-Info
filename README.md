👋 Hi, I’m Iran.

💼 I’m a data analyst transitioning from biotech. My work involves data manipulation, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis using R, Python, SQL, and I am learning Tableau.

👀 I also enjoy creating custom software to automate and streamline my work.

💞️ I like connecting with fellow coding enthusiasts. I’m actively building my portfolio to showcase my work.

📝 I share my journey on Github about transitioning from biotech to data analytics and tackling impactful projects.

🐕 I am also a proud parent of a GERMAN SHEPHERD who is sometimes an asshole.
